#A CASINO ADVENTURE

#A college group project involving : 
@JuztDoNot - Developed the IDEA and wrote the BLACKJACK and SLOTS Minigame
@Shamdogg - Helped create the ROULETTE Minigame
@Starvingseagull - Helped create the DICE Minigame

#Description
This program is a basic CASINO GAME for a PYTHON CLASS. Loosely inspired by "LAS VEGAS STAKES" while including small easter eggs and jokes depending on what you input, (for the most part). This game is a "Text-Adventure" game and does not include visuals (yet...). Although not impressive, this project has blood, sweat, and possibly more blood put into it!
CASINO ADVENTURE includes: BLACKJACK, SLOTS, ROULETTE, AND DICE
